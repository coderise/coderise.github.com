						| Teaching with Coderise has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my life, since it brings together my two great passions, programming and teaching. The quality of the Coderise students has been excellent.  I am impressed that students in 9th grade not only understand programming concepts but are also motivated to investigate beyond the classroom and apply what they learn. -- Julian David Duque, Coderise Instructor

						| It"s nice to think that the existence of the Internet means that anyone with a computer and access to the web can become a success through sheer will power and hard work. Reality is not quite so simple. Coderise recognizes that educational opportunities and exposure to positive role models play a critical role in every software developer"s life. Combine my interest in tech entrepreneurship with my wife Theresa"s anthropological research into economic opportunity in Latin America, and its easy to see why backing Coderise is the perfect way for our family to give back. -- Tom Preston, CEO Github
